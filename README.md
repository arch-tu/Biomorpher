# Biomorpher
Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms for Rhino Grasshopper.

As opposed to metaheuristic algorithms requiring an explicit objective function (such as Galapagos), Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) allow designers to engage with the _process_ of evolutionary development itself. This gives rise to an involved experience, helping to explore the wide combinatorial space of parametric models without always knowing where you are headed!

This work is sponsored by the 2016/17 UWE VC Early Career Researcher Development Award and was initially inspired by Richard Dawkins' _Biomorphs_ from his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design.
